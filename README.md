Iâ€™ve recently developed a data dashboard using SN Corporationâ€™s dataset, providing deep insights into various facets of the business. From tracking customer acquisition and sales performance to analyzing customer demographics and operational efficiency, this dashboard highlights key trends and opportunities.
I've been working with SN Corporation's dataset to create a comprehensive dashboard that provides valuable insights into various aspects of the business. ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡

This dataset was obtained by attending the PowerBI workshop conducted by Jatan Shah

Hereâ€™s what the dashboard covers:
ðŸŽ— Customer Acquisition: Tracking the growth of our customer base over time.
ðŸŽ— Sales Performance: Monthly revenue trends and peaks.
ðŸŽ— Product Performance: Identifying top-selling products.
ðŸŽ— Customer Demographics: Understanding our customer base by region.
ðŸŽ— Customer Retention: Analyzing retention rates and patterns.
ðŸŽ— Sales by sub-categories: Distribution of sales across different sub-categories with respect to shipment modes.
ðŸŽ— Operational Efficiency: Insights into order fulfillment times.
ðŸŽ— Financial Performance: Quarterly profit margin analysis.
ðŸŽ— Market Share: Market share distribution by product category.

These insights are helping us to drive better decision-making and strategic planning. ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ

Questions addressed by the dashboard include:
âž¡ How has our customer acquisition rate evolved?
âž¡ What months show the highest and lowest sales revenue?
âž¡ Which products are leading in sales?
âž¡ How do customer demographics vary across regions?
âž¡ What are the trends in our customer retention and satisfaction?
